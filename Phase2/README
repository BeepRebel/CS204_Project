How to build
------------
For building:
	$cd src
	$make

For cleaning the project:
	$cd src
	$make clean


How to execute
--------------
Run the simulator by providing a .mc file as input:

./myRISCVSim ../test/simple_add.mc

The simulator will process the instructions and display execution logs.


Features:
--------------
      -Implements a Functional Simulator for a subset of 32-bit RISC-V ISA instructions.
      -Simulates the five-stage execution pipeline: Fetch, Decode, Execute, Memory, Writeback.
      -Prints detailed logs at each stage, including instruction execution and register updates.
      -Handles memory read/write operations and generates output memory/register files.
      -Supports an exit instruction (0x00000000) to terminate execution and save memory state.


Supported Instructions:
-------------------------
- R-format: add, and, or, sll, slt, sra, srl, sub, xor, mul, div, rem

- I-format: addi, andi, ori, lb, ld, lh, lw, jalr

- S-format: sb, sw, sd, sh

- SB-format: beq, bne, bge, blt

- U-format: auipc, lui

- UJ-format: jal


Output Format:
-------------------------
During execution, the simulator prints detailed logs. For example:

FETCH: Retrieved instruction 0x00A00513 at memory location 0x00000000
DECODE: Identified addi operation | Source: X0 | Immediate: 10 | Destination Register: X10
EXECUTE: ADD 0 and 10
MEMORY: Memory stage bypassed (no load/store operations)
WRITEBACK: Register X10 updated with value 0x0000000a
Clock Cycle: 1

Additionally, output files:

       -registerFile.mc → Stores register values after execution.
       -memory.mc → Stores memory contents after execution.

GUI Integration:
-------------------------
The Graphical User Interface (GUI) is implemented in Python using Tkinter. It provides an interactive way to:

       -Load .mc program files easily.
       -Run the RISC-V simulator and view real-time execution logs.
       -Monitor register and memory values dynamically.
       -Reset and reload programs for repeated execution.
       -Save execution outputs for further analysis.

The GUI automatically detects the simulator executable and integrates seamlessly with it.

How to Use the GUI:
-------------------------
1)Run the GUI
       python gui/gui.py

2)Load a Program
       -Click on Load Program and select a .mc file.
       -The selected program is displayed in the GUI.

3)Run the Simulator
       -Click on Run to execute the program.
       -The execution logs will be displayed in the Output Tab.

4)View Register and Memory State
       -The Registers Tab displays updated register values.
       -The Memory Tab allows searching for memory locations and viewing their contents.

5)Save Output
       -Click on Save Output to export execution logs.

6)Reset Simulation
       -lick Reset to clear all states and prepare for a new program.

By integrating the GUI, the simulator becomes more user-friendly and interactive, making it easier to visualize the execution of RISC-V programs.
